# Getting Started with Noti

## Getting started
### A step by step guide to get the Noti bot running on your Discord server.

Let's explore how to use Noti on your own server. We'll cover the fundamental steps, settings, best practices and later on tutorials for different use cases. While you can use built-in slash command via chat, this guide only covers setup via the online interface - the [Web Dashboard](https://notibot.app/dashboard).

## 1) Invite Noti to your Discord server

In order to use the Noti Discord bot and its features, you must first invite Noti to a server. You can invite the bot through the following ways:
  
  - **Noti's website**: Visit [https://notibot.app/](https://notibot.app/) and click on the "Invite Bot" link from the top right.
  - **Noti's dashboard**: In [Noti's dashboard](https://notibot.app/dashboard) - there will be a list of servers you can Noti to.
  - **Discord's App Directory**: Search for "Noti" or [click here](https://discord.com/application-directory/719310199944642753) and press the "Invite" button.

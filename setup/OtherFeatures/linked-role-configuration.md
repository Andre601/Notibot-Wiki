* The process is exactly the same as **/sync** or **Synchronize** button in the panel
* Discord user needs to click on the guild name on the top left of the server, and go to **Linked Roles**
* User should click on the role name with the Noti icon beside it
* User then clicks on the Noti (BOT) option on the next screen
* This will take the user to https://api.notibot.app/linked which will give the code to put in [Noti Kick Chat](https://kick.com/noti/chatroom)
* Once completed, the linked role will be applied to the user and cannot be revoked unless the user unlinks their Kick account from Noti

A user can also link their Kick account via [User Profile -> Settings](https://notibot.app/dashboard/settings) -> **Kick** by clicking the **+Connect** button

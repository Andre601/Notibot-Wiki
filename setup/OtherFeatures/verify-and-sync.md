# Verify and Sync

**Run the Command:**&#x20;

To begin, use the `/sync` command with the required parameter for the social platform you want to link, in this case, `social:kick`. The basic command is `/sync social:kick`.



**Follow the Prompt:**&#x20;

After running the command, Noti Bot will respond with a prompt providing step-by-step instructions on how to link your account. It will also provide you with a unique code.



**Copy the Code:**&#x20;

Copy the code provided in the bot's message. This code is essential for the linking process and will be valid for 5 minutes.



**Go to "Noti" Channel:**&#x20;

Now, go to the "Noti" channel in your Discord server. You can find this channel in the server's channel list.



**Paste the Code:**&#x20;

In the "Noti" channel, paste the code you copied earlier. You can either find the code provided in the bot's message or visit [https://kick.com/noti](https://kick.com/noti) to get the code.



**Success Message:**&#x20;

After successfully pasting the code, Noti Bot will send a success message in the same "Noti" channel. This message confirms that your account is now linked!



**Auto Sync on First Entry:**&#x20;

From now on, your account will be automatically synced the moment you join the server.



**Resetting the Linking (Optional):**&#x20;

If you ever need to reset the linking process, you can use the `/sync` command again with the <mark style="color:orange;">`reset:true`</mark> option, like this:

* <mark style="color:orange;">`/sync social:kick reset:true`</mark>

Follow the prompt to link your account again.

And that's it! You've successfully linked your account with Noti Bot for the "Kick" social platform. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

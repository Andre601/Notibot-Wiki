# Noti's Dashboard Web Interface Initialization

In order to receive live notifications in your Discord server, you have two options to choose from for setting up Noti: the slash commands or the web dashboard. \
This guide will lead you through the step-by-step process of initializing Noti's dashboard web interface.

## Web Dashboard Login

1. Head over to [https://notibot.app/dashboard](https://notibot.app/dashboard)
2. You will be prompted to sign in with your Discord account if you have not already. \
    â€¢ Please note: *Signing in with Discord allows Noti to provide you with a list of servers to select from that you have the Manage Server permission for.*
3. Once you have logged in with Discord, you will be presented with a list of servers that you have **Manage Server** permission for.
4. Click the **Add** button directly below the server logo you wish to add Noti to.
5. Follow the on screen prompts to add Noti to the server(s) of your choice.
6. Once you have successfully added Noti to your server, you will need to return to the [Noti Dashboard](https://notibot.app/dashboard) where you will now see a **Manage** button in place of the previous Add Button.   

If you have successfully completed the steps listed above, your dashboard should look similar to the following: \

# Noti's Dashboard Web Interface Initialization

In order to receive live notifications in your Discord server, you have two options to choose from for setting up Noti: the slash commands or the web dashboard.

## Web Dashboard Login
This guide will lead you through the step-by-step process of initializing Noti's dashboard web interface:

1. Head over to [https://notibot.app/dashboard](https://notibot.app/dashboard)
2. You will be prompted to sign in with your Discord account if you have not already. \
    • *Signing in with Discord allows Noti to provide you with a list of servers to select from that you have the Manage Server permission for.*
3. Once you have successfully logged in with your Discord, you should see the following screen: \

## Accessing User Settings
4. Connect your socials to synchronize roles on your server and manage your profile with the `Configure` button, which gives the following options to configure: \
    • **Birthday**: Set up your birthday date. Please ensure you are entering the correct date as this cannot be changed later. Format: DD/MM (e.g. 20/12) \
    • **Global Language**: Set your global language for Noti. \
    • **Kick**: Connect/disconnect your Kick.com account \
    • **Twitch**: Connect/disconnect your Twitch.tv account \
    • **Twitter**: Connect/disconnect your Twitter account

## Selecting a Discord Server To Manage

5. Provided you have previously completed steps 1 - 3 from the Web Dashboard Login section above, you will be presented with a list of servers that you have **Manage Server** permission for. 
{% hint style="info" %} **Should You Add or Manage a Server?** \
**Add** is for servers you wish to add Noti to \
**Manage** is for servers Noti is already joined to
{% endhint %}

### How to ADD a Server
6. Click the **Add** button directly below the server logo you wish to add Noti to. 
7. Follow the on screen prompts to add Noti to the server(s) of your choice. 
{% hint style="warning" %} **Warning** \
*Changing the default permissions that Noti is granted is not recommended as it may affect its intended performance or functionality.*
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %} **Success!** \
Once you have successfully added Noti to your server, you may return to the [Noti Dashboard](https://notibot.app/dashboard) where you will now see a **Manage** button in place of the previous Add button.
{% endhint %}

If you have successfully completed the steps listed above, your dashboard should look similar to the following: \

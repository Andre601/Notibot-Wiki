# â–º Leaderboard Auto Roles

- This is a new feature designed to seamlessly grant roles to your leaderboard members.  With this, you can grant up to the top 3 roles for each position of weekly, monthly, or overall sub gifting.

{% hint style="info" %}To get started, you need to configure a **Kick streamer** in your **Noti Dashboard** -> **Kick** section.  
{% endhint %}

Once you have a Kick Streamer configured, go back to the list of Streamers, and click the **Configure** button next to the streamer you want to have the Leaderboard role sync for.

Then, click on the **Leaderboard** link along the left side of the Kick Streamer configuration page.

On this tab, you can select from **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or **Overall** in the first dropdown for your leaderboard period.

Next you can select the role to receive, for each leaderboard period.  This will be a list of roles currently present in your Discord server.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to create a **new role** for this, you'll have to **create the role in your Discord server first**, then click the blue refresh icon on the top right to refresh the list of roles.
{% endhint %}

Lastly, you can select the **amount of roles** you want to give based on that leaderboard period based upon the top gifter(s) for that role period.

For example, if you select **Weekly** from the dropdown, **Sub Gifter of the Week** from the roles dropdown (assuming you have a role called that), and **1** from the number picker, it will grant the top weekly gifter the Sub Gifter of the Week role.

Click **Save** at the bottom when you're done configuring the role periods.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can remove the auto roles at any time by clicking on the **X** button at the end of of the 3rd column next to the role you want to remove, and then click **Save**.
{% endhint %}

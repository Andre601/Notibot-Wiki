## Upgrading with [NotiBot.app](https://notibot.app)

1. Head over to the [Premium page](https://notibot.app/premium).
2. Be sure to `Login` before attempting to subscribe.
3. At the top, select whether you want to bill `Monthly` or `Annually`. If you choose to pay annually, you will receive 2 months free!
4. On the **Buy Premium** window, set your desired plan configuration from the list of available options, select your server and then click the `Buy` button to proceed

{% hint style="warning" %}
Prepaid or re-loadable cards and PayPal balances cannot be used to purchase premium since it is a recurring subscription; therefore, you must use a bank-issued card or have one attached to your PayPal account in order for the transaction to be successful.
{% endhint %}

### Paying via Debit/Credit Card

1. Enter your card details. Be sure that all details are correct.
2. Click the `Purchase` button at the bottom of the pop-up and Noti will start processing your subscription.
3. If it succeeds, Noti Premium will automatically be activated on the server you selected.
